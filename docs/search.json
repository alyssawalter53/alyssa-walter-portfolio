    "text": "Alyssa Walter graduated with her B.S. in Marine Science and a Statistics minor from California State University, Monterey Bay in May 2025. She began conducting research as a freshman with Dr. Alison Haupt, and later joined the Ocean Predator Ecology Lab under Dr. Salvador Jorgensen, where she led a project analyzing injuries on great white sharks. Project Shark Scar is an undergraduate-driven initiative to study insights into shark life histories, reproduction, behavior, and anthropogenic threats. Alyssa also developed a shark education outreach program through the lab to foster conservation awareness among students and residents in Monterey County. As a NOAA Hollings Scholar, she interned with the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary where she analyzed elasmobranch movement with satellite telemetry and contributed to science communication efforts. Alyssa was fortunate to receive support through programs such as LSAMP, UROC Scholars, NOAA Hollings, CSU COAST, PALiISaDS, and the Sally Casanova California Pre-Doctoral Scholarship during her time as an undergraduate at CSUMB. Beyond research, Alyssa served as the Associated Students College of Science Senator, Chair of the AS Committee of Colleges, and sat on multiple committees shaping the future of CSU Monterey Bay’s infrastructure and leadership. She was also a four-year member of the Otter Dance Team, and loved to represent CSUMB at national collegiate dance competitions. Alyssa intends to pursue a Ph.D. where she can continue studying the movement ecology and reproductive behaviors of marine top predators to support conservation efforts for species of ecological and economic importance."

    "title": "Exploring Trends in Shark Landings by US Commercial Fisheries",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Data Description\nData Source.\nMy data comes from the NOAA Fisheries Commercial Landings Database, which tracks reported commercial landings of fishes. I utilized their website to select data for 12 large pelagic shark species landed across the U.S.\nVariables and Data Types.\nMy data contains commercial fisheries landings from 1915 to 2023, and provides insight into trends in shark landings by state. The dataset includes the following variables: - Year, year of the recorded landings. -State, U.S. state - NMFS Name, National Marine Fisheries Service common name of each species - Pounds and Metric Tons, weight of sharks landed - Dollars, market value of the landed sharks - Confidentiality, whether or not the data is confidential - Collection, whether it was commercially or recreational caught - Scientific Name, scientific name of each species - Tsn, Taxonomic Serial Numbers are a numeric code for the species - Source,original source of the data\nResearch Questions\n\nAre there trends in the value of shark landings (in dollars) over time?\nWhich shark species have the highest commercial landing weights (weight of all sharks cought) over time?\nHow do the prominent species landed vary by US state and region?\nWhat data source (fisheries management organization) had the highest average shark landings in the last 5 years?\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\nTo get my dataset ready for visualizations, I first cleaned the variable names to make them easier to work with, and viewed a summary of the data to identify what needed cleaning. Then, I adjusted how certain pieces of information were stored: I made sure the year was treated as a number, removed symbols and commas from the weight and dollar columns so they could be calculated properly, and grouped together categories like state names and species names. I also removed rows that were marked “Confidential” since they didn’t include usable data, and deleted columns that weren’t relevant to my project. For any dollar or weight values that were recorded as zero, I marked them as missing so they wouldn’t affect the results. After this data cleaning, I saved the updated dataset and created a new dataset that showed the total pounds of sharks landed and total dollar value for each species, by state and year. I added a new column that grouped states into larger regions, such as “New England” or “Pacific Coast”—based on NOAA’s region definitions, and saved this dataset. I then created another dataset that totaled shark landings and dollar values by year alone. Finally, I created a wide-format version of the data, where each species had its own column, which may be helpful for certain and analysis.\n\nI used help from AI (ChatGPT) to create the regions dataframe, and to make sure the tideous process of spelling all state names and regions was done correctly.\n\n\n\nData Visualization 1\nThis line graph shows total U.S. commercial shark landings from 1950 to 2020. The x-axis represents years in ten-year intervals, while ther are two lines on the y-axis. One line, in blue, shows the total pounds of sharks landed, steadily increasing through the 1980s and peaking in the early 1990s before declining. The other line, in dark green, shows the total dollar value of those landings, which generally follows the same trend as total catches. The y-axes on both sides of the plot display pounds and dollars, respectively. As we can see, the most commercial shark landings occurred around the late 1990s ( coinciding with the highest dollar value of landings), with a secondary peak during the 2010s. The number of shark landings must be monitored, as there is high variability in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal pounds of U.S. commercial shark landings (blue), and total dollars (green) over time. Source: NOAA Fisheries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualization 2\nThis line graph shows total commercial shark landings in pounds from 1950 to 2020 for the five most frequently caught species. Each species is a different color, layered to show how their relative contributions change over time. The predominantly caught shark over time is the Spiny Dogfish.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 5 commercially landed shark species over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualization 3\nThis horizontal bar chart shows U.S. states on the vertical axis and total pounds of sharks landed on the horizontal axis. Each bar represents the shark species with the highest commercial landing weight in that state. Bars are color-coded by shark species, and the total pounds landed are labeled at the end of each bar. The chart highlights the variation in dominant caught shark species across states based on commercial landing weight in pounds. The predominantly caught shark across states is the Spiny Dogfish.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop shark species by total pounds landed per state by commercial fisheries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualization 4\nThis heatmap shows the total shark landings in pounds by U.S. coastal region from 1950 to 2022. Each tile represents a year-region combination, shaded by total pounds landed. Lighter shades indicate higher landings. The Pacific coast shows the earliest landings, while New England region shows highest landings (in 1990).\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap displaying annual shark landings (in pounds) across U.S. fisheries regions from 1950 to 2022. Darker colors indicate higher landings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Visualization 5\nThis bar chart displays the average shark landing weights, measured in pounds, from various fisheries management organizations over the most recent five years (2015-2020). The Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program has the highest average landings by a large margin (just over 1,600,000 lbs). The Pacific Fisheries Information Network, Exceptions, and the Alaska Fisheries Information Network are significantly lower than the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program. The chart provides a clear comparison of how shark landings differ across these organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBar chart of average shark landing weights (in pounds) by commercial fisheries over the last 5 years."
