    "text": "My name is Alyssa Walter and I am a senior majoring in Marine Science and minoring in Statistics at CSU Monterey Bay. I am currently serving as the AS College of Science Senator, and am a NOAA Hollings, Sally Casanova, and UROC Scholar. My research focuses on elasmobranch movement ecology and reproduction, with an emphasis on enhancing our understanding of the oceanâ€™s top predators to support conservation efforts for species of ecological and economic importance. I am looking forward to using the skills, networks, and experience I have gained during my time as an undergraduate to aid in my pursuit of a PhD in Marine Ecology and Fisheries Management."
